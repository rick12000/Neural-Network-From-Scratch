# Neural-Network-From-Scratch

Neural Network with custom number of layers and neurons without any OOP or classes. By default it only prints out in sample performance.

The model has a final sigmoid activation for binary classification with binary cross entropy loss.

It has no adaptive learning rate, so it is quite sensitive to network architecture and weight initializations and will require tweaking for every dataset.
